This is a project I did for two of my PhD programme subjects, it involved
development of a rule engine and the DMN standard. It started with me only
attempting to create an implementation of the standard, but I could not find a
rule engine that suited my needs, so I wrote my own. The rule engine is called
[ruly](https://github.com/zlatsic/ruly) and the implementation of the standard
is [ruly-DMN](https://github.com/zlatsic/ruly-dmn). Both are open-sourced and
can be viewed on my GitHub profile. I am not actively maintaining them as, to
my knowledge, they aren't used anywhere but if this changes, I might start.
