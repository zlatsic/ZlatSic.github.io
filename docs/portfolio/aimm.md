# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Main product of my PhD, a software component/framework for AI model
integration, focused on IIoT systems. Built for fast prototyping of integrated
supervised machine learning models. Interfaces to its environment are highly
generic (and changeable), allowing for a wide range of purposes, even stepping
out of the industrial automation related problems. Open sourced and available
[here](https://github.com/hat-open/aimm). Contains the implementation and
several examples of usage, some more generic, some focused on energy industry.
