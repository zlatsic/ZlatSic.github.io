# {{$frontmatter.title}}

The AIMM component, described in [the previous portfolio entry](aimm.md), got
additional coverage with a scientific article describing the way it is
implemented and integrated into a Hat-based SCADA system. The paper gives a
thorough description of its architecture and the integration practices. It is
followed up with a concrete case study that uses the component to perform power
grid state estimation, which serves as a proof of concept. The paper was
published in [IEEE Access](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9734070) and it
is available through open-access.
