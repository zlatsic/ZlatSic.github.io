# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Collective effort of my team at Končar that ended up being [open
sourced](https://github.com/hat-open/hat-core). I contributed as one of the
developers, writing implementations and tests. The repository contains
different libraries and components for SCADA-like software products and was
used as a core for different projects we did afterwards. I also used it in my
various personal projects and PhD experiments.
