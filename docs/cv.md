### Doctor of Science (2019-ongoing)

Doctoral study focusing on application of machine learning to SCADA systems.
My research focused on machine learning application to SCADA systems. It
involved development of a [SCADA component](portfolio/aimm.html) that could
seamlessly analyze data within the system and expose its conclusions over
SCADA's interface.

Full programme available
[here](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/studies/doctoral/study_programme).

### Master of Science in Computing (2015-2017)

Continuation of the bachelor's programme, kept with the specialization for
Computer Science with application development. This programme featured more
concrete subjects, such as object-oriented design, machine learning, soft
computing and deep learning. My thesis focused on a piece of software I wrote
that implements configurable framework for management of machine learning
models. I applied this framework and used it to solve the problem of gas
consumption forecast. The second part of the research, application of the
framwork was later used as the topic of my first conference paper, featured in
my [portfolio](portfolio/gas_forecast.html).

### Bachelor of Science in Computing (2012-2015)

Basic education for a software engineer, started by learning basics of
programmming languages C and Java.The later years of the programme featured
more practical subjects, such as databases, object-oriented programming,
network programming and artificial intelligence.
