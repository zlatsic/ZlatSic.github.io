# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Last one - defended the PhD Feb. 6th so not much to add after it. Let's dig in.

## Past

In the last one I wrote "Hopefully, 2023 is the year I complete my doctorate.",
ha! Turned out a bit more then that, but it wasn't a difficult task as it was
mainly just passing feedback back-and-forth between myself and my supervisor,
with breaks in between for reading.

Not too eventful overall. My superviser showed great patience with our
collaboration, ensuring the thesis is up to standards. I'm happy with the way
it looks, it's well structured and most people in IT could read it and pick
things up from it. I might make it publicly available, if it's allowed, if not,
reach out to me and we can just talk about it.

## Present

I'm just resting now :D Some side projects are looking quite tempting, though.

## Future

I don't really have any plans for future in academia, I've gotten out of it in
the meanwhile, as I didn't really publish anything. It would be interesting to
publish a conference, or go do some independent research and see if I can push
it somewhere. I'd be interested in doing some topics other then SCADA AI,
depending on what side-project I pick up.

Speaking of side-projects, open-source will remain an interest. I hope to start
up some projects I can make publicly available, maybe also contribute
somewhere.

## Conclusion

Overall this was a very positive experience. I wouldn't say it hindered my
regular life too much, especially in these later years, and I managed to get an
experience I'll value for the rest of my life. I'd like to thank again to all
my collaborators for the help, I hope we get to do it again sometimes :)
