Welcome to my site! My name is Zlatan Sičanica and I am a software developer
specializing in SCADA development and application of artificial intelligence
(primarily machine learning) to that domain. Here I will banter in the form of
blog posts and post updates to the projects I am working on. Feel free to
browse or get in touch with me, I am always looking forward to further
discussing any content written here.
