Welcome to my site! My name is Zlatan Sičanica and, as it is probably obvious
from the content above, I am a software developer specializing in SCADA
development and application of artificial intelligence (primarily machine
learning) to that domain. Here I will banter in the form of blog posts and post
updates to the projects I am working on. Feel free to browse or get in touch
with me, I am always looking forward to further discussing any content written
here.
