Welcome to my site! My name is Zlatan Sičanica and I am a software developer
specializing in web development, including application of artificial
intelligence (primarily machine learning) to those domains. Here I will banter
in the form of blog posts and post updates to the projects I am working on.
Feel free to browse or get in touch with me, I am always looking forward to
further discussing any content written here.
